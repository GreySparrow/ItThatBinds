# Dev Log 1: Launch
*Date: February 1st, 2020*

The beginning of February is, for Grey Sparrow Games, the beginning of a journey. This blog and hub will be the home of a development log and feature showcase for **It That Binds**, a tactical RPG inspired by classics of the genre. 

## Setting
Conceptually, the game's main goal is to develop the hubworld and build the strength of your party to take on greater challenges. A multi-verse anomaly has caused great instability in the world, creating a climate of great uncertainty and fear. Time marches on as before, but space has taken on a different meaning. The anomaly has opened up holes in the fabric of reality, enabling matter to cross between realities. These holes have created chaos at every level. Free movement of biological beings and material goods between the timelines have given birth to a lawless, unpredictable landscape.

The Player sits in Hearken Hamlet, a small vilage positioned at the nexus of multiple anomaly structures. The village, once lowly, has become somewhat of a hub for those with a sense for adventure. To cross through the holes in reality is to risk it all. Not every universe behaves in the same way, and though time ticks on at the same pace, uniting the worlds, each anomaly expresses reality in a slightly different way, reflecting an infinite dimensional theory. Each foray into an anomaly, although predictable in some ways, is a unique experience with its own challenges. 

As groups of adventurers foray into the anomalies, the outcomes vary greatly. As the universes that lie on the other side are just as valid as that of the hamlet, some find themselves tempted to stay. Some look to bring great riches back to their homeland, some look to escape persecution, and some thirst for the knowledge that can reside in a different reality.

The player takes on the roll of the omniscient and mysterious Tinker, an organizer of exhibitions to through the anomalies and leader of the hamlet. Each expedition into the anomaly is an opportunity to learn and grow the villages power, with the ultimate goal of acquiring wealth, power, and mastery of the multiverse. The tinker develops the martial and technological abilities of the village, putting to use the exotic technologies, magics and materials discovered through expeditions, bolstering the capabilities of the raiding parties. 

## Physa and Mysa
In addition to time, two more universal "building blocks" unite the universe:
 - **Physa**: is a representation of biological life-force. This life force represents the basis for all matter, and obey the laws of modern physics. Physa is inherently stable and reliable, as its structure provides predictable outcomes.
 - **Mysa**: also referred to as planar energy (and the cause of the anomolies), Mysa is fuel for the arcane and the chaotic. If one desires to break the laws of the universe and create or destroy, Mysa must be harnessed. The tidal, crackling energy that is channelling Mysa is a fragile art; even small amounts of this energy flowing through a biological conduit has the potential to "burn out" the host. 
 
 Physa builds the blocks and makes the rules, and Mysa stomps around like an angry pigeon and knocks the rules over.
